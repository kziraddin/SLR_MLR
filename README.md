Simple Linear Regression (SLR)
Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a single independent variable (predictor) and a dependent variable (response) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The goal of SLR is to find the best-fitting line (or a linear equation) that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed data points and the predicted values along that line.

Key points:

SLR is suitable when there is a clear and straightforward relationship between two variables.
The linear equation can be represented as: y = mx + b, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, m is the slope, and b is the intercept.
SLR provides insights into how changes in the independent variable affect the dependent variable.


Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is an extension of Simple Linear Regression and is used when there is more than one independent variable. In MLR, the goal is to model the relationship between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable using a linear equation. This method is widely used in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.

Key points:

MLR allows you to consider the impact of multiple independent variables on the dependent variable.
The linear equation can be extended to include multiple independent variables: y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bn*xn, where y is the dependent variable, x1, x2, ..., xn are independent variables, and b0, b1, b2, ..., bn are coefficients.
MLR can capture complex relationships in the data and provide insights into which independent variables are significant predictors of the dependent variable.


In both SLR and MLR, the quality of the model is assessed through various statistical measures, such as R-squared, p-values, and the coefficients of the model, to understand how well the model fits the data and whether the independent variables are significant predictors of the dependent variable. These regression techniques are fundamental tools in data analysis and predictive modeling.
